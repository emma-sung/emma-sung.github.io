# Welcome to Emma's Portfolio Page!

## About Me

Hello! My name is Emma.I am an engineer transitioning into data analytics with a strong foundation in mechanical engineering and hands-on experience in both corporate and research settings. 

Currently, I work as an engineer at The Boeing Company in Everett, WA, where I extract, clean, and analyze large datasets to develop key performance indicators, manage compliance, and enhance system reliability for a fleet of over 1,000 aircraft. My role at Boeing has sharpened my expertise in data analytics, business intelligence, and risk analysis—all essential to maintaining safety and efficiency on a massive scale.

Prior to Boeing, I completed a Master’s project at Cornell’s Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab, where I led cost analysis and collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate sensor systems into a collapsible rover. I also gained experience in acoustic sensor analysis and control systems during my engineering internship at BlueVortex, LLC.

My toolkit includes SQL, Python, Tableau, and MATLAB. I am passionate about converting raw data into actionable insights. My recent data analytics projects include an energy market case study, where I analyzed outage data and created Tableau visualizations to drive operational improvements, and a lung cancer case study, where I visualized patient data to highlight high-risk factors.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new cuisines, cooking, and occasionally tennis! :)

## Project 1: [Fraudulent Card Transactions](Financial%20Transactions.ipynb)

About:

I am currently working on an exciting capstone project focused on analyzing fraudulent transaction behavior using Python's scikit-learn and advanced modeling tools.

The project is actively evolving, and you can explore the progress in my Jupyter Notebook. Once the analysis is complete, I will create a comprehensive presentation in Tableau to showcase the findings.

Data Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/transactions-fraud-datasets/data)

Tools: 

- Python: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data modeling and visualization
- Jupyter Notebook: For iterative coding and analysis
- Tableau: For creating a visually engaging and interactive dashboard


## Project 2: [AEMR Electrical Outage Case Study](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emma.sung/viz/SQLProject_17271275130480/Story1)
About: 

This project explores a transactions dataset to uncover patterns and indicators of fraudulent activity. By analyzing various transaction attributes, I aim to identify key characteristics that distinguish legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones.

Using data visualization and statistical techniques, I delve into trends, anomalies, and correlations within the dataset to develop insights that could enhance fraud detection strategies. This analysis could inform businesses on how to better safeguard against fraudulent activities and improve the security of financial transactions.

This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and exploratory data visualization to solve real-world challenges.

Tools: Python, Tableau

Python Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy


## Project 2: [Lung Cancer Study](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emma.sung/viz/capstone_1_17236881162380/LungCancerDataAnalysis)

About: 

In this project, I focused on analyzing and visualizing data to identify high-risk factors associated with lung cancer severity. My goal was to uncover meaningful patterns within patient demographics that could inform better understanding and support research on risk stratification.

Using Tableau as my primary tool, I designed visualizations that highlighted correlations between variables like age, smoking history, and other demographic factors with risk. These visualizations allowed for quick insights into key demographic patterns and offered a user-friendly approach for stakeholders to explore data and identify trends.
