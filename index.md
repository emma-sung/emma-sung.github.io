## About Me

Hello! I’m Emma, a data analyst with a strong foundation in mechanical engineering and hands-on experience in both corporate and research settings. Currently, I work as a Flight Controls Design Engineer at The Boeing Company in Everett, WA, where I extract, clean, and analyze large datasets to develop key performance indicators, manage compliance, and enhance system reliability for a fleet of over 1,000 aircraft. My role at Boeing has sharpened my expertise in data analytics, business intelligence, and risk analysis—all essential to maintaining safety and efficiency on a massive scale.

Prior to Boeing, I completed a Master’s project at Cornell’s Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab, where I led cost analysis and collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate sensor systems into a collapsible rover. I also gained experience in acoustic sensor analysis and control systems during my engineering internship at BlueVortex, LLC.

With a toolkit that includes SQL, Python, Tableau, and MATLAB, I am passionate about converting raw data into actionable insights. My recent data analytics projects include an energy market case study, where I analyzed outage data and created Tableau visualizations to drive operational improvements, and a lung cancer case study, where I visualized patient data to highlight high-risk factors.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new cuisines, experimenting with cooking techniques, and understanding the science behind flavor.

## Project 1: [AEMR Electrical Outage Case Study](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emma.sung/viz/SQLProject_17271275130480/Story1)
About: 

In this case study, I worked on analyzing energy market data for the American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) using SQL and Tableau. The goal was to derive insights that could inform regulatory decisions and optimize market operations. Through SQL queries, I performed data transformations and aggregations to prepare the data for visualization.

Using Tableau, I created dynamic dashboards and visualizations to communicate key trends and patterns in energy outages. These visualizations highlighted critical metrics such as frequency of outages, energy loss, and main contributors of outages, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. The project allowed me to apply advanced data manipulation and visualization techniques to support identification of pain points, ensuring transparency and efficiency in energy market operations.

Tools: SQL, Tableau

## Project 2: Lung Cancer Study
About: 

In this project, I focused on analyzing and visualizing data to identify high-risk factors associated with lung cancer severity. My goal was to uncover meaningful patterns within patient demographics that could inform better understanding and support research on risk stratification.

Using Tableau as my primary tool, I designed visualizations that highlighted correlations between variables like age, smoking history, and other demographic factors with risk. These visualizations allowed for quick insights into key demographic patterns and offered a user-friendly approach for stakeholders to explore data and identify trends.
